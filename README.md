# Neural Network (MNIST) Hand Written Numbers

Julia implementation of a back propogation neural network as inspired from the book: Make your own neural network. 

Initial score 0.967428 accuracy on the Kaggle MNIST Digit Recognizer data set. That is training on 
42000 hand written numbers and the test set consisting of 28000 hand written numbers. 

# Score Improvements 
Added inverted drop out + 20 epochs score = 0.9751%

To do: Add drop out and bias
Add original image rotations and make the original images more noisy.
